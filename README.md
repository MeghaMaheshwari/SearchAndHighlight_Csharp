# SearchAndHighlight_Csharp

The code here uses the docx dll to search for words in the microsoft word document and higlights them. It than searched the value 
of the word and retreives them
for example if your document has contents like
 " I got 10 sheeps, cows 15 and oranges for $20.00."
 
 You search for sheeps, cows and oranges. As a final output you wil see these words higlighted with a yellow color in the docx 
 and the value tha you will get is
 
 sheeps -> 10
 cows -> 15
 oranges -> 20.00
 
 Eventually we will use these values to plot a graph. I developed this code mainly to help a student and a beginner in C#
